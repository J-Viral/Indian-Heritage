            <p>A land resounding with the riches and glories of opulent dynasties, powerful rulers, flourishing civilisations and profound history, India has a splendid heritage that is reflected in its architecture, monuments, arts, crafts, cultures and even religions. 
                While formidable forts, ancient temples and grand palaces testify of the grandeur of times gone by, the various museums and galleries scattered across the country act as inventories of India's seamless past. 
                Such is the magnificence of the structures in the country that UNESCO has identified several of them as heritage sites.

            <h2>Clothing</h2>
            <p>Clothing in India varies with the different ethnicities, geography, climate, and cultural traditions of the people of each region of India. Historically, clothing has evolved from simple garments like kaupina, langota, achkan, lungi, sari, to rituals and dance performances. In urban areas, western clothing is common and uniformly worn by people of all social levels. India also has a great diversity[1] in terms of weaves, fibers, colors, and the material of clothing. Sometimes, color codes are followed in clothing based on the religion and ritual concerned. The clothing in India also encompasses a wide variety of Indian embroidery, prints, handwork, embellishments, and styles of wearing clothes. A wide mix of Indian traditional clothing and western styles can be seen in India.</p>
